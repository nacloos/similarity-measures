TODO: ask brainscore to update their setup?

Cloned the brainscore repository and modified the setup.py to allow newer versions of scikit-learn.

https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/issues/327

Can't directly overwrite it in the requirements.txt


TODO: how to install only brainscore.measures? (don't need all the requirements)


TODO: problem using brainscore module. Just copy paste measures folder here...


Delete brainscore tests because don't want them to be run by pytest
